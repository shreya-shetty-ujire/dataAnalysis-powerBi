## HR Analytics Dashboard
#### This project aims to provide insights into employee attendance trends using HR data. The data is transformed from an Excel sheet and visualized using Power BI to analyze employee presence, work from home (WFH), sick leave, and overall attendance percentages.

### Data Transformation
#### The HR data is stored in an Excel sheet. To prepare the data for analysis in Power BI, the following transformations were applied:
#### Data Import: The Excel sheet containing HR data was imported into Power BI.
#### Data Cleaning: Missing or inconsistent data entries were cleaned and standardized.
#### Data Modeling: Relationships between different data tables were established for analysis.
### Measures and Analysis
